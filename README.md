Eat-Da-Burger! Homework

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. This application is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) deployed in Heroku. It follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

### How to Use:

The application has 2 sections -- the `Add/Update a Burger` section on the left and the `Eat Some Burgers!` section on the right. `Eat Some Burgers!` has 2 sub section. The first one is `Burgers to Devour!` which has the burgers that haven't been devoured while the `Devoured!` has the burgers that has been devoured.

1. Add a Burger
    - The section where user can add a burger. Just enter the name of the burger, description, then click the `Add` button. Whenever a user adds a burger's name and description, the app will display the burger on the `Burgers to Devour!` -- waiting to be devoured. Name and Description only accepts letters, numbers, and some special characters (!,.-).

2. Update a Burger
    - `Update` button is used to update/change each item's name and description. Once it is clicked, the burger data will show on the left side/section (`Update a Burger`). Name and Description only accepts letters, numbers, and some special characters (!,.-).

3. Devour a Burger
    - To devour a burger, click the `Devour It` that is on each burger item. The app will display the burger on the `Devoured!` section.

4. Add/Remove a Favorite Burger
    - To make a burger your favorite, click the `Favorite` button displayed on each burger. The favorites burguer will have a rainbow colored burger icon on the right side of it's name. Remove a burger to your favorites by clicking the `Not Anymore` button.

5. Delete a Burger
    - Delete a burger by clicking the `Delete` button on a specific burger item. This deletes the burger in the database.
